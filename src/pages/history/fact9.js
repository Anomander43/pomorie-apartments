    <h2>Vine growing and Wine producing</h2>
    <p>
    The golden-plated trays of the Thracian kings Amadok and Terez II were filled with sparkling wine, which was produced just here.
    Many coins that were minted in the ancient town, viewed a bunch and the God of wine â€“ Dionisy. They are dated at the time of the Roman Emperors Antonius Pius and Marcus Aurelius. There are evidences for a flourishing wine production in this region.
    Nowadays Pomorie is a prominent vine-growing center as well. The products of the local wineries capture prestigious awards at national and international exhibitions.
